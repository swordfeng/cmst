/**************************** resource.h *******************************

Header file that contains program #defines.  It used to be that we kept
all program update and version information in this single file.  Now
we've moved a lot of that to txt files inside the /text directory which
are compiled in as a resource.  This seems to result in a faster 
compile, but we now have manage information in two locations.
